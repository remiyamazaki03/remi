  "testimonial1": "“ <strong>I thought of myself as bad singer with limited range.</strong> During the lessons <strong>Remi always encouraged me.</strong> One of the exercises was making a pig face. She said “making an ugly face is part of the vocal lesson. <strong>Nothing to be ashamed of!”</strong> That's it. I had nothing to be ashamed of. <br/> Remi helped me to widen my range, and to change from my chest voice to falsetto naturally. <strong>After two months of training, I could sing songs which I never expected to sing.</strong>” <br/> - T. K. (online, Brazil)",
  "testimonial2": "“The result was stunning. At first, both myself and the [musical] actor were quite sure of his upper range limit, but <strong>after Remi's coaching, he sang notes I (thought I) knew he couldn't hit, all with 100% presence and confidence onstage.</strong> Remi encouraged and helped many of us to step up and boosted our production level, and I'm very grateful to have had the opportunity to work with her.” <br/>- W. R-L. (Musical director, USA)",
  "case2": "... you want to branch out, and sing notes and styles you've never sung before:",
  "testimonial3": "“I didn't know I had this side of my voice!!! Given proper [guidance], <strong>it was an amazing feeling to push past the limits I thought I had</strong>.” <br/>- J. L. (online, USA)",
  "testimonial4": "“<strong>I've been singing in a choral way for more than 20 years and singing in a different style (such as pop, musical) was very challenging for me</strong>. Remi's way of teaching was very fun and also very easy to understand. Thanks to her, I was able to learn how to project my voice in different styles using different parts of muscles! <strong>Now I can use my chest voice to sing powerful songs and I even performed in front of an audience!!</strong> Her lessons definitely gave me confidence in singing!” <br/> - A. T. (online, Japan)",
  "case3": "... you want to take your singing to the next level, or step up your professional game:",
  "testimonial5": "“Before these lessons, all I thought about was matching pitch, but <strong> I learned how to breathe, how to do vibrato, dynamics, and other techniques to help me become better at singing - all customized to my level. </strong> And when I didn't understand something, Remi explained it with a lot of care. I can sing so many more songs now than before!” <br/>- C. N. (online, Japan)",
  "testimonial6": "“I'm an actor and I love musicals, but I couldn't sing. Remi not only told me that yes, I could sing but also helped me prepare my singing audition. <strong> She believed in me when I didn't believe in myself, and after that, I'm not afraid of auditioning for musicals anymore! </strong>” <br/>- V. H. (in person, USA)",
