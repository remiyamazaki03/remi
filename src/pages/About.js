            <br />I am a classically trained singer, with experience in musical
            theatre and pop (including JPop)... but my go-to genre is gospel. I

            <br />I was born into a teachers' family and have been teaching for
            more than 15 years, and will always be an educator (empowerer!) at
            heart. I believe that <b>everyone</b> can sing, and that everyone
            has the right to be able to express themselves freely through song -
            and I love helping people achieve this through{" "}

            I'm from Japan and have lived here most of my life, but I've also
            lived in New York City where I performed at 54 Below (Off Broadway),
            with the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir (gospel choir with 6 Grammy
            Awards), and at numerous jazz clubs around the city. Before that, I
            attended Princeton University, where I received training in French
            acting and earned a Bachelor's in Comparative Literature.
