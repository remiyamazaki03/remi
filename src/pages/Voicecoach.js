                    “I like singing but going to karaoke with friends was
                    embarrassing for me because I thought of myself as bad
                    singer with limited range. During the lessons Remi always
                    encouraged me. One of the exercises was making a pig face.
                    She said “making an ugly face is part of the vocal lesson.
                    Nothing to be ashamed of!” That's it. I had nothing to be
                    ashamed of. <br />
                    <br />
                    Remi helped me to match pitches accurately and widen my
                    range, and told me how to change from my chest voice to
                    falsetto naturally. After the two-months training, I could
                    finally sing the song which I never expected to sing. I had
                    never tried to sing with my falsetto because it was too weak
                    and high, but now I learned to sing strongly with my breath
                    control and forming voice. Now my options for karaoke have
                    increased dramatically.” - T. K. (online, Brzail)

                    “I didn't know I had this side of my voice!!! Given proper
                    instructions [during the voice lessons], it was an amazing
                    feeling to push past the limits I thought I had.” - J. L.

                    “The result was stunning. At first, both myself and the
                    [musical] actor were quite sure of his upper range limit,
                    but after Remi's coaching, he sang notes I (thought I) knew
                    he couldn't hit, all with 100% presence and confidence
                    onstage. Remi encouraged and helped many of us to step up
                    and boosted our production level, and I'm very grateful to
                    have had the opportunity to work with her.” - W. R-L.

                  “Before these lessons, all I thought about was matching pitch,
                  but I learned how to breathe, how to do vibrato, dynamics, and
                  other techniques to help me become better at singing - all
                  customized to my level. And when I didn't understand
                  something, Remi explained it with a lot of care. I can sing so
                  many more songs now than before!” - C. N. (online, Japan)

                  “I'm an actor and I love musicals, but I couldn't sing. Remi
                  was the first person who not only told me that yes, I could
                  sing but also helped me prepare my singing audition. She
                  believed in me when I didn't believe in myself, and after
                  that, I'm not afraid of auditioning for musicals anymore!” -
